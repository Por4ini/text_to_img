In my third year of college, I visited the local city library and happened to meet a really attractive girl. I struck up a conversation with her, and we chatted for a while. She mentioned she was single, so we exchanged email addresses. Unlike me, she wasn't a college student; instead, she was studying for a clerical position at a hospital.

We exchanged emails for a bit, but it was a challenge to find a suitable time for a date since she was always working, and I had my school commitments. Eventually, I discovered that she was going through a tough time with her ex-boyfriend. She wanted to break up with him but didn't want to let me go because she claimed to have genuine feelings for me and believed in my promising future.

Our casual dating began a few months after that fateful library encounter. We embarked on exciting dates, explored new places together, and spent countless hours discussing our dreams and goals. The more time we shared, the more I realized how much I cherished her companionship. We shared many laughs, and she possessed a remarkable ability to brighten even my darkest days.

After a couple of months of casually dating, I started noticing that our time together was increasing significantly. It felt like we were already in an unofficial monogamous relationship, and I was perfectly fine with that. My feelings for her had deepened, and I could sense that she felt the same way about me.

Although we both had separate living spaces, we had plans to move in together once my current lease expired. It seemed like a natural progression for our relationship, and we were both enthusiastic about sharing a home. She explained that she had cut ties with her ex-boyfriend after their breakup due to his irresponsible behavior. He refused to pay rent and had children from different women.

While her past was somewhat troubling, I trusted her judgment and believed she had made the right choice. However, as our relationship developed, there were instances when I couldn't shake the feeling that she was hiding something. She occasionally didn't answer her phone or took an unusually long time to respond to my texts, leaving me feeling frustrated and anxious.

I tried to dismiss these concerns, thinking that perhaps she was simply busy or preoccupied with other matters. But after days of uncertainty, I finally gathered the courage to address the issue directly. I wanted her to be open and honest with me. When I confronted her, she disclosed that her ex-boyfriend was stalking her.


It was an astonishing revelation, and I found myself torn between believing her story or not. My mind was filled with doubts and questions. Despite my uncertainty, I decided to approach her explanation with caution. One day, as I was returning from a friend's house, I had a hunch that she might be at home, so I decided to pay her a visit. It wasn't meant to be a surprise; in those days, we didn't have cell phones like we do now, and I had dropped by unannounced a couple of times before.

As I approached the door of her apartment, to my astonishment, I encountered a man exiting her place. He was carrying a large box, and we passed each other in the hallway. I couldn't help but feel startled by this discovery, particularly since she had previously informed me that he was stalking her. It didn't add up to me that she would permit him into her apartment if their relationship was genuinely hostile. She assured me that he had come to retrieve his belongings, and the supposed stalking was due to some of his property still being in her possession.

However, as she continued to assert this explanation, I couldn't help but begin to question whether she might be manipulating the truth. The whole situation appeared dubious, and I couldn't shake the persistent suspicion that there might be more to the story than she was disclosing. At that point in our relationship, I found myself at a crossroads, uncertain if I could place full trust in her.


As the semester drew to a close, our impending plan to move in together approached, but my doubts lingered. Following the incident with her ex-boyfriend, she became remarkably affectionate, going the extra mile to express her love through cooking for me and thoughtful gifts. Part of me suspected that she might have sensed my uncertainty and was attempting to rekindle our romance. I must admit, I was easily swayed by such gestures, and over time, she slowly began to regain my trust.

As we took the step of moving in together and our relationship deepened, I believed everything was going smoothly. However, one unexpected day, she brought up the idea of an open relationship out of nowhere. I was taken aback, as I had never contemplated such an arrangement before. She spoke about the potential freedom and liberation it could offer, but I was unsure how to respond, so I chose to remain silent, hoping she would abandon the topic.

Little did I realize that this was merely the start of a revelation that would challenge my understanding of our relationship. During an intimate moment, she began sharing her desires regarding engaging in zexual encounters with multiple partners. At the time, it felt like a form of foreplay, and I didn't give it too much thought in the heat of the moment.

However, once our passion had cooled, her words lingered in my mind, and I couldn't shake the feeling that she might genuinely want to turn this fantasy into a reality.

My mind was consumed by these thoughts, and I found myself deeply contemplating the potential consequences of such a proposition. I began to question whether our love and commitment to each other were sufficient for her, and the idea of sharing her with someone else stirred up unsettling feelings within me.

The uncertainty surrounding whether I could accept this weighed heavily on my emotions. This unexpected revelation left me torn and confused, leaving me unsure of how to navigate the situation. It led me to doubt the strength of our love as it seemed our desires were diverging. As I grappled with my emotions, I recognized the need to take some time to process everything before making any decisions about our future.

Following her expressions of desire during our intimate moments, which didn't resonate with me but seemed to please her, we engaged in further discussions. She disclosed that her ex-boyfriend had a penchant for watching her with other men and once again proposed the idea of an open relationship.

Respectfully, I declined, explaining that I had no interest in such a lifestyle. Unfortunately, my decision didn't sit well with her, and she responded with passive-aggressive behavior, attempting to provoke me. Her efforts to irritate me didn't yield the desired results, so she gradually became less affectionate and even withheld intimacy as a way of expressing her frustration, likening my behavior to that of a child.

This situation began to weigh heavily on me, occupying my thoughts and causing my academic performance to suffer due to a lack of concentration in school. After careful deliberation, I made the difficult choice to terminate the relationship. Upon returning home, I mustered the courage to convey my feelings to her, explaining that I no longer wanted to continue the relationship and that it would be best for her to find another place to live.

Regrettably, her reaction was marked by anger, and she resorted to physical aggression, accompanied by hurtful name-calling and desperate pleas in an attempt to change my decision. However, I had already resolved to move forward with my studies and focus on my future, believing that there was no room for such drama in my life. The next day, she startled me by claiming to be pregnant.

I approached this claim with skepticism, wondering if it might be a tactic to manipulate me into reconsidering our breakup. Nonetheless, she sent me photos of pregnancy test results, seemingly attempting to validate her assertion. Despite this evidence, I remained resolute in my choice to end the relationship, as I couldn't shake the nagging suspicion that she might have obtained the results from various sources to deceive me.


As time went on, the situation became more worrisome. Two months later, she messaged me, telling me that she had missed her period once again. Then, four months later, she sent me a photo of her growing baby bump. During this period, mutual friends informed me that they had seen her with other men, including her ex-boyfriend. This led me to consider the possibility that I might not be the father of her child.

However, I couldn't ignore the fact that we had engaged in unprotected intercourse around the time of her pregnancy. Though I usually use a protection, there was still a chance that something might have gone wrong, adding to my uncertainty. Given that I was in my final year of college and quite young, I felt unsure about how to handle the situation.

Nevertheless, I was aware that if the child was indeed mine, I had a responsibility to step up and be a responsible father. Throughout her pregnancy, she vehemently asserted that the child could only be mine, despite my lingering doubts about her involvement with other men during our relationship. Reluctantly, I went along with her claims.

Coincidentally, I happened to be out of town when the baby was born, and she tried to reach me. However, this was in a time before cell phones were prevalent, so communication was limited. I had traveled to a different city with a college friend for a weekend getaway, partly to avoid being at home during the birth, as I had growing doubts that the child might not be mine.


After the baby's birth, I visited them a few times in the following weeks. Not long after that, my parents told me that she had come to their house and introduced the baby as their new grandson. They were thrilled and looking forward to being grandparents. However, I had to stop everything and explain to them that I was quite certain the child was not mine.

The moment I saw the baby, I felt no connection whatsoever. Though it was a baby, I didn't see anything in the child that resembled me in any way.

Since she was already receiving government assistance, the state mandated a paternity test. This is a routine procedure when someone is receiving state or government aid, like food stamps, as they need to identify the father for child support purposes. Given the circumstances, I decided it was best to proceed with the paternity test as scheduled.

When the paternity test results came back, they showed that there was less than a 1% chance that the child was mine.

With this conclusive evidence, I decided to make a clean break and move forward. The two times I saw her afterward, which was over 20 years ago now, she appeared almost tearful as she tried to apologize for what she had put me through back then.

Through word of mouth, I eventually learned who the real father was, and it turned out to be her ex-boyfriend, the same one she had claimed was stalking her, the one I even encountered leaving her apartment with some boxes. Unfortunately, he already had other children from different relationships and couldn't provide any support for them.

Unfortunately, his health problems and struggles with pills led to his untimely death, leaving the child without a father figure. Throughout this difficult situation, I remained composed and fully cooperative, which resulted in a commendation letter from the county prosecutor's office for my responsible conduct.

It was evident that she pursued me because I was in college and had a promising career ahead.

I genuinely believed that she thought the child was mine, or perhaps she convinced herself to the point of believing it. While I didn't hold any resentment toward her, the combination of how she handled the situation, her suggestion of an open relationship, and the infidelity was enough for me to decide to end the relationship.
