My fianc√© and I have been in a relationship for just over 7 years, living together for the past 4, and engaged for the last 3. He's 27, and I'm 26. For this story, let's call us Seamus and Sharon. Over the past year, our relationship has started to exhibit some age-related strains, although nothing so severe that we couldn't overcome...

Neither of us believes that legal marriage is essential, although I would have been okay with it if he had agreed. We believe that a natural commitment is far more important than a legal document, and we planned to remain engaged and committed to each other for life. Additionally, we intended to start having children within the next 12 to 18 months... Our issues arose from Seamus's workaholic tendencies...

This began affecting our intimacy... When we initially got together, we were intimate all the time, sometimes multiple times a day. This decreased to about 3 times a week around the third year, and last year, it was more like 2 times a week. Now we're down to less than 2 times a week, and sometimes we go more than a week without intimacy. My desire for Seamus remains as high as ever, but his desire for me has plummeted due to his work commitments.

He acknowledged that the stress and exhaustion from his job were causing issues but didn't take any action to address it. Last year, he received a promotion to assistant manager. This new position came with a higher salary, but considering the long hours he puts in, he's actually earning less per hour than before! It's hard to see how that's a promotion. We've had numerous conversations about this, but he insists he's doing it for our future and our future family.

Seamus explained that he was working diligently and saving money so that we could eventually buy a house, allowing me to stay home with our first child. I work at a call center for a bank, and I despise it. While I appreciated his sacrifice, I was simply asking for a bit more of his time and affection. When I pressed the issue, things would improve temporarily, but then he'd revert back to working, and I felt like an afterthought.

Even when he was at home, he would often be on his laptop handling store-related tasks or speaking with employees or customers on the phone. It became incredibly frustrating. During his rare moments of free time, instead of spending it with me, he preferred gaming and was part of a few gaming groups. He mentioned that gaming was a stress reliever for him and encouraged me to join, but it wasn't something I was interested in.



I sensed that even though he still loved me deeply, something was missing in our relationship, and we appeared to be growing apart. This brings me to the current situation.

As I mentioned earlier, I work at a large call center where some of my colleagues are involved in open relationships or marriages. They claim that it has significantly improved their love lives. One of my co-workers, whom I'll refer to as Jessica, had extensive conversations with me about this topic.

About a month ago, she mentioned that she and her husband were interested in exploring an open relationship involving both Seamus and me. She admitted that she found Seamus very attractive, and her husband thought I was quite appealing. I firmly declined this proposition because we were friends outside of work, and the idea felt unsettling. Additionally, considering we worked in the same department, it could potentially lead to tension and HR-related problems.

Despite my clear rejection, she occasionally brought up the topic, causing me to distance myself from our friendship. I couldn't help but see her differently once I learned of her interest in Seamus. While we still had lunch together at times, we no longer spent time together after work. Several weeks ago, Jessica informed me that the IT guy responsible for our department was in an open relationship with his wife.

He's an attractive older man, perhaps in his very late 40s, and he's a kind, soft-spoken person who's in excellent shape. Jessica suggested I should talk to him if I had any interest in exploring this topic. I told her I wasn't interested and that she was the one who kept bringing it up with me.

However, several days later, this man, whom I'll call Taylor, approached me in the breakroom and asked if he could join me. I agreed, and he took a seat.

We engaged in small talk for a while, and then he mentioned that Jessica had informed him that I might be open to the idea of an open relationship. I was taken aback because I couldn't believe Jessica had the audacity to share something like that after our conversation.

I explained to Taylor that I wasn't really interested and clarified that Jessica, along with a few others, had been discussing this concept with me, but it didn't pique my interest.

Taylor suggested I should consider it, emphasizing that it can be quite healthy and beneficial for a relationship. He also mentioned that if I ever became interested, he would be honored to explore that path with me. I felt somewhat offended, but his approach was so calming and considerate that I didn't take it as an offense. I simply smiled and thanked him, saying I would keep it in mind if I ever changed my perspective.


We continued our small talk for the remainder of the break. Later that afternoon, I found myself pondering my conversation with Taylor. I thought to myself that if I were ever to consider an open relationship, he would be an ideal partner for it. He appeared very mature and respectful, plus he's married with kids, so there's no risk of anything more happening, as he made it clear he loves his wife and children.
Of course, I feel the same way about Seamus. He's my soulmate, and even if we were to explore such a thing, my love for him would remain unchanged. When I returned home that night, Seamus called and informed me that he would be working until 8:30 pm because someone had called out sick at the last minute. I was quite upset about this because he was originally supposed to be home by 5, and we had plans for a romantic dinner and a special evening together.
He apologized and promised to make it up to me when he got home. However, that night he didn't arrive until after 9, and when he did, he was completely exhausted and just collapsed on the couch. I was so frustrated that I left him sleeping there and went to bed. Around 3 am, he came into the bedroom, kissed me, but I pretended to be asleep. I was just so upset by his apparent disregard for me.



The following morning, he left for work early and gave me a quick peck on the lips, but I didn't respond with a kiss. Later in the morning, he called to apologize once more for the previous night, but then immediately mentioned that his district manager had made a surprise visit to their store. He explained that he and his manager would be going out to dinner with him after work.
I responded sarcastically, telling him to share something I wasn't already aware of. He inquired about what I meant, and I pointed out his habit of returning home late. I asked him when was the last time he came home at a reasonable hour. He concluded the call by expressing his love for me. All I managed to say was, "Alright, bye," before hanging up. I was visibly upset, so I requested an early lunch break, which my manager approved.
While I was in the lunchroom, Taylor noticed my distress and came over to sit with me. He could tell that I was quite upset and began talking to me in his soothing manner. By the end of my break, I felt considerably better. Before we returned to work, he invited me to join him and some of his IT colleagues for happy hour. He suggested it would be beneficial for me to go out and not spend the evening alone at home.


Feeling somewhat obliged since Taylor had cheered me up and made me feel better, I agreed to go with him to happy hour. During our time there, we had a great conversation. We discussed his marriage in detail and how he and his wife were going through something similar to Seamus and me. Taylor mentioned that opening up their relationship had actually saved their marriage, and they are still happily together to this day.
After we left happy hour, I felt that tonight might be a good time to broach the subject with Seamus and gauge his reaction. Seamus arrived home around 9, and I asked him about his meeting with his district manager. He said it went well. Then, he inquired about how my evening at happy hour went, and I told him it was fine but admitted that I would have enjoyed it much more if he had been there with me.
I chose not to reveal that I had been there alone, engaging in a conversation with another guy, even though it was innocent. When there was a pause in our conversation, I brought up the topic of five people I work with who are in open relationships. Seamus hadn't heard about this before and asked if it was about people sleeping around with others while staying together. I replied, "Yes, something like that."


He expressed his disapproval, calling it both stupid and disgusting, and suggested that those in such relationships should simply break up to be free to sleep with whomever they desire. I explained that the purpose of these relationships wasn't to encourage infidelity but rather to strengthen the bond between couples. He found this idea ridiculous and asked for an explanation, to which I had no response. That's when I mentioned Jessica and her husband.

He questioned if I was joking, and I assured him I wasn't. He wondered why I hadn't told him about this earlier, and I admitted I was afraid he might not want to spend time with them. He conceded, saying he wouldn't be hanging out with them anymore because he found it distasteful.

After that, he continued probing with more questions about the topic. He asked for my opinion on it, and I replied that if it worked for those involved, then it was their choice. He further inquired if I would ever consider something like this, and I clarified that I would only do it if he were in agreement. He seemed surprised by my response and repeated, "So you're telling me that if I agreed to this, you would do it?" I confirmed, "Yes, BUT ONLY if you agree to it." His reaction was simply, "Wow, wow, OK," accompanied by a somewhat perplexed look.

Our conversation ended when he received a call from his Dad and spoke with him for nearly 20 minutes. Afterward, we started making out and had a special night together, a refreshing change. However, during the following week, Seamus consistently worked late, sometimes past 7 PM, due to a sudden employee resignation without notice. Feeling frustrated, I decided to join Taylor for a drink again.

We headed out right after work and stayed until 7 PM. During this time, we delved deep into discussions about open relationships and how such an arrangement might work for both of us. I must admit, our conversation ventured into some sensitive territory, crossing boundaries, but it remained purely conversational. Afterward, I ordered takeout from the bar for Seamus and me and returned home without informing Seamus about my time with Taylor.

For the subsequent week, things appeared to be improving between Seamus and me. Although he still worked late, he managed to get home before 7 PM. We had plans for a nice dinner on Thursday to celebrate our 7th year together. However, the night before, Seamus informed me that his Regional Manager was coming in the next day and had scheduled an unexpected operations review.


He apologized and suggested that we postpone our anniversary celebration to Friday. I could tell he sensed my disappointment, but I reluctantly agreed. He also mentioned that he needed to spend the evening in our home office to prepare for the following day, which meant he couldn't join me for our planned TV time. I felt extremely upset and just overall frustrated by the situation.

The next morning, he woke up before 5 AM and left the house around 6 AM. He kissed me goodbye and mentioned that he might not be back until after 9 PM because the Regional Manager had plans to take him and his manager out for dinner. I replied with an understanding "OK," as it was what I had anticipated. Before he left, I asked him if he promised to take me out the next day, and he assured me that he would be home by 5 PM, no matter what. We shared another kiss, and he departed.

Throughout my workday, I couldn't help but dwell on the prospect of spending yet another evening alone. Just as my shift was concluding, I received a chat message from Taylor, asking if I'd like to join him for a drink after work. I contemplated it for a while before eventually agreeing. I decided to head home first to freshen up before meeting him at the tavern, arriving shortly after 5 PM. Our outing lasted until nearly 8:30 PM.

While I was at the tavern with Taylor, Seamus sent me a text message asking, "Where are you?" My response was a simple, "I'm at the tavern with some people from work," which was technically true since there were a couple of colleagues from the loan processing department sitting at the bar. Following that, I inquired about how things were going with his Regional Manager, to which he replied, "Fantastic, absolutely fantastic." I responded with, "Great, see you later."

I must admit that some of the conversation Taylor and I engaged in that evening was highly inappropriate and deeply personal. We discussed topics such as preferences and positions, among other things. Towards the end of the night, he began to touch and hold my hands until I withdrew them. Then, as he walked me to my car, he surprised me with a long hug, followed by an unexpected kiss on the lips.

The kiss caught me off guard, and though I didn't voice my discomfort at the time, I believe he picked up on my body language and realized I didn't appreciate it. I left for home, eagerly anticipating seeing Seamus and discussing his meeting and dinner with the Regional Manager. However, when Seamus arrived home, he behaved normally, except for the fact that he didn't come over to kiss me as he usually did.



I inquired about how his meeting with the Regional Manager had gone, and he responded with "great" without elaborating further. He then asked about my work day, and I described it as the usual: non-stop calls and high stress. His next question was about happy hour and who had attended. I replied that it was fine and that it consisted of people from the IT department, most of whom he hadn't met.

He followed up by asking how many people were there, to which I replied, "I don't know, maybe 8 or 9, something like that." Feeling uneasy about lying, I inquired about his dinner. He revealed that they hadn't had dinner because his Regional Manager had decided to return home early to be with his wife and encouraged Seamus and his manager to do the same with their significant others due to their successful ops review.

My heart sank upon hearing this news. I then asked where he had been until now, and he replied, "At the tavern... looking for you." A wave of sickness washed over me, realizing I was caught, but not entirely sure. That's when Seamus confirmed, saying he had seen everything. I asked him what he meant, and he explained that he had witnessed me with that man, smiling and gazing at each other. He saw us holding hands and even observed us hugging and kissing.


I was at a loss for words, so I simply said, "You don't understand." He responded, "No, I do understand... Now it all makes sense why you brought up an open relationship out of nowhere last week. You were seeking permission to be with this guy." He then asked me how long I had been cheating on him, and I assured him that I hadn't cheated and that our interactions had been limited to conversations.

I expressed my deep remorse, but he told me that apologies wouldn't suffice this time. His voice trembled as he mentioned how I had shattered his trust and broken his heart. Overwhelmed with guilt, I began to cry and continued to apologize, but he refused to listen. He said he was leaving to stay with his Dad for a while, and I pleaded with him not to go, begging for his forgiveness. However, he remained resolute.

He departed, and I called him while he was en route to his Dad's house. He informed me that he wasn't ready to talk at the moment and needed distance to sort things out. I inquired about what that meant, and he replied, "You know what that means." I persisted with my apologies and pleas for forgiveness, but he remained silent and eventually ended the call without saying good night.


Later, I walked into the bedroom and noticed that most of his clothes were gone, except for a couple of old winter coats, a few baseball caps, and an old pair of shoes. It became clear that he had already packed his belongings before I arrived home and had gone somewhere until I got back. That explained why he came in after I did. I couldn't hold back my emotions and collapsed on the bed, desperately hoping that this was all just a dreadful nightmare.

Every day, I sent him text messages expressing my deep apologies and regret for my actions, along with declarations of my love for him. Although the messages were delivered, he never responded. I sank into a deep depression, prompting some of my girlfriends from work to come over on Saturday evening in an attempt to lift my spirits. They eventually took me out, and for the first time in nearly 8 years, I got incredibly drunk.

I was sleeping off the effects of that night on Sunday morning when I heard someone knocking at the door. I peered out and saw that it was Seamus. I felt a rush of happiness upon seeing him, but wondered why he didn't simply use his key to come in. When I opened the door, I immediately embraced him and poured out my feelings, telling him how much I loved and missed him and how depressed I had been since he left.


He asked me to take a seat because he had something important to discuss. My immediate response was to start apologizing, but he cut me off, saying he didn't have time to waste on that because his Dad was waiting for him in the car. Then, he revealed that he had been promoted to a store manager position. I congratulated him enthusiastically and gave him a warm hug. I expressed my pride in his hard work and emphasized that no one deserved this promotion more than him.

He dropped the bombshell that the store he'd be managing was in another state, and he would be relocating in just two weeks. I was utterly devastated and desperately asked if I could go with him. His reply shattered me: "No, I'm breaking up with you." Tears welled up, and I pleaded with him, asking why he was doing this. His response was blunt: "You know why."

In despair, I inquired about my future, and he coldly informed me that I would have to figure it out on my own. He then revealed that he had already terminated the lease on our apartment. Fortunately, the rental manager agreed to reduce the remaining 8 months of the lease to just 60 days. Rents in our area had significantly increased since we signed the lease, and the landlord could easily rent it out at a higher rate.

Seamus mentioned that he had taken care of the final lease payment, but if I wished to remain in the apartment after 60 days, I would need to sign a new lease. He was well aware that I couldn't afford to live there without him since he covered two-thirds of our living expenses.


He informed me that I could keep all the furniture and the commitment ring he had given me. I couldn't hold back my tears and pleaded with him for another chance, but his response remained firm: "No, it's over." In my distress, I rushed to the bathroom, fearing I might throw up. When I returned, he had disappeared. I called him, desperately wanting to talk, but he explained that his Dad was waiting, and he had to leave. My attempts to converse with him were in vain.

The rest of the morning was spent on the bathroom floor, a combination of crying and feeling sick to my stomach. In the afternoon, two of my work friends came over and immediately noticed how distraught I was. They asked for my Mom's contact information, called her, and explained the situation, telling her that I needed her because Seamus had ended our relationship. Mom made the three-hour drive and arrived late last night (Sunday evening).

Now, it's early Monday morning, and I've been a restless wreck all night. So, here I am, putting my thoughts on paper, seeking any advice on what steps to take next. Is there anything I can do to make this right? I'm aware that technically, I cheated on Seamus by engaging in secret conversations with Taylor. However, it's crucial to note that we didn't go beyond a kiss and a hug, and remember, he initiated the kiss; I didn't respond to it.


I've truly learned my lesson and would never repeat such a mistake. If Seamus decides to give me another chance, I promise I won't let him down. Right now, I'm facing the darkest period of my life, and I could really use some love and support. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Feel free to ask if you have any questions.



First Update - 74 days after my initial post.

Hello, everyone. I'm returning because many of you have been asking about my situation. Currently, I'm in a really tough spot, and I've moved back to my parents' house. When the lease ended, I left my job at the bank, and with the help of my Dad, Mom, and brother, we moved my belongings back home, and they are now stored in the garage.

To say that I'm broken right now would be an immense understatement. My mental state is worse than words can describe. Without my family's support, I don't know where I'd be at this moment. In fact, I might not even be here. I'm overwhelmed with regret and yearn to turn back time and make better choices. Looking back, I now see everything so clearly and understand what I foolishly gave up.


To make things even worse, about a week before I left to return home, I bumped into Seamus' father at the gas station. We've always had a good relationship, and we chatted for around 15 minutes. During our conversation, he revealed that Seamus had come looking for me at the restaurant on the night I was with Taylor. He wanted to share the news of his promotion and ask me to go with him. Hearing this completely devastated me.

I've had a couple of phone conversations with Seamus since he moved. He mentioned that he's genuinely happy with his new job, despite being incredibly busy. I've sincerely apologized to him, and he graciously accepted my apology, thanking me for the wonderful years we spent together. He made it clear that, in his view, we're not a good match and won't be a couple again. However, he wants us to maintain a civil relationship.

This has been incredibly painful for me, more than words can express, but I'm not pressuring him or acting clingy. I'm simply grateful that he's still willing to talk to me. During our last call a couple of weeks ago, I let him know that if he ever changes his mind, I'd be on the next flight out to see him.

So, that's pretty much the update for now. I have my first therapy session scheduled for next week, and over the past week, I've submitted job applications to several places.


Please remember me in your prayers, and I genuinely appreciate all the support and kindness you've extended to me, even though we're complete strangers.
