Update.
Something I forgot to mention is that after I found out that she was cheating on me, I went and got an STD test, and it came out clean. After I caught her affair partner on my Ring, I haven’t had closeness with my wife since. I was always the one that initiates it in the relationship, so she wasn’t actively seeking It from me. Moreover, she is already having love with her affair partner, and I believe that this last time she visited him they most certainly had closeness, because there was no reason for her to spend 30 minutes in that location.
After work I was able to track down that area she visited, come to find out, it was a mechanic shop. I also saw the unmistakable 1964 Pontiac GTO. The car that I saw on my street the day I almost caught someone running out of my backyard. I felt mad that this guy was in my house, I felt disrespected and wanted to confront him there, but I had to talk myself out of it. Its eerie to know that he knew my backyard so well that it was probably not the first time that he has been there. I parked my work van a few blocks away from his shop to have a better view of it for a stakeout. it was getting late, so I stayed there till I notice him coming out of the shop with another friend, they had already closed the garage doors of their shop, and were standing in front smoking. I wasn’t sure if they were smoking cigarette or MJ because I was too far away to see. I should be heading home, but I couldn’t stop waiting and staring at them. At the back of my mind, I was trying to compare myself to him, and questioning why my wife chose him over me, why my wife chose to betray me with him. Something about his life excited her, and that is something I cannot become.
Maybe she was tired of pretending to be a good person and just decided to show her true colors. After they were done smoking, he got into his car and drove away. I decided that this was my chance to follow behind him to find out where he lives, he already knows where I lives, he had already been to my house several times, already ducked my wife several times, it’s only fair that I know where he lives so I can break up the relationship he has with his girlfriend. Eventually, I want to hurt this man. A lot of dark thought going through my mind. I had a concealed hand tool a Springfield Hellcat in my car. I thought about driving up to him and destoy him there. But I will probably be the number one suspect it they knew that he was ducking my wife. He drove in his car in front of a restaurant and picked up a woman. At first, I assume that the woman was his girlfriend, so I took some pictures with my phone. The picture wasn’t clear because it was getting dark, I was parked on the street so he wouldn’t know that I was tailing him. He picked up the female passenger and drove off, I trailed behind him. They reached an apartment with street parking, and I could tell by their body language that she wasn’t his girlfriend. I noticed that they were touchy-feely, and couldn’t get their hands off each other, like a new couple as they got into the apartment. I suspected that she must be another one of the women he was ducking. I debated whether to wait for him to come out, so I could follow him and find out where he lives, but there is no telling when he would come out, so I decided to take a picture of his license plate number, and I drove home for the day. Now I know that this guy is not only a dealer (pills dealer) he is also a womanizer, and my wife happens to be one of the women he is fraternizing with.
The next few days were really depressing, it was hard to sleep in the same room as her. I was starting to lose hope and wanted to call it off and just divorce her already so we could go our separate ways, because sooner or later she is going to figure out what the Ring bell was all about, or she is going to find the voice-activated recorder or the hidden camera I was using to spy on her. It was a very boring week of her talking to her affair partner, and watching her on camera smoking in the backyard, at least twice a day. I figure it may take her about 3-4 weeks to finish her MJ stash, and I didn’t want to wait that long. I couldn’t live with her in that house that long knowing that she was ducking another man, I wanted to rap this up. I figure that I could remove some of her stash, so it would force her to go and get some more. So, when she went to bed, I went to the backyard with my flashlight and dug up her bag of MJ. I notice that she also had some tobacco mixed with the MJ, in any case, I took more than half of the content, return the rest, and then went to bed.
 served my wife divorce papers, we have 76 days for the divorce to be finalize. The house hasn’t sold yet but we have two strong interests, me and my soon to be ex-wife still lives in the same house and we sleep in different bedrooms. My daughter is no longer speaking with my wife, and I am playing mediator because I want them to get along, my sons still maintain relationship with their mom, but they have lost respect for her immensely, I know my family will never be the same and I have come to terms with that. Concerning her Affair partner, I heard he was released on bail, but still going to court, case still pending, I think he is going to get more than two years in prison, hopefully.
